# CausaliPy

Causal Methods implemented in Python.

## Installation

Install via

```bash
pip install causalipy
```

It might make sense to add the py-arrow dependency (which is currently required
for the example):

```bash
pip install pyarrow
```

## Example

To run a version of the multi-period difference-in-difference estimator as
proposed by Callaway and Santâ€™Anna (2020) (this requires additionally pyarrow - e.g. via
`pip install pyarrow` - to be installed currently):

```python
from causalipy.did.multi_periods import MultiPeriodDid
import pandas as pd

url = "https://github.com/mohelm/causalipy-datasets/raw/main/mpdta-sample.feather"
data = pd.read_feather(url)

mpd_minimum_wage = MultiPeriodDid(
    data,
    outcome="lemp",
    treatment_indicator="treat",
    time_period_indicator="year",
    group_indiciator="first.treat",
    formula="~ 1",
)
mpd_minimum_wage.plot_treatment_effects()
```

This will give:

## TODO:

Leg 1:
- OLS standard errors
  - Huber-White Clusters
  - Clustered standard errors
    - Question: what is the `fixef.K`
  - Homogenous standard errors
- Fix effect estimator (for OLS) with standard errors



- Think about how to handle test datasets and what to use?

Leg 2:
Work on interface

Release

Leg 3:
Add some more DiD stuff

RDD/ Synthetic control
